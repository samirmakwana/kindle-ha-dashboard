# Home Assistant Dashboard for Kindle
Inspired by the [Kindle-SmartHome-Display](https://github.com/1RandomDev/kindle-smarthome-dashboard/) project, this is a boilerplate solution optimized to work on Kindle Paperwhite (2021) (11th Generation).

Here's how it works: You create a websocket-proxy for Home Assistant and make it work with the KUAL-friendly extension for a jailbroken Kindle. 

A few quick things:
- The images work as temporary place holders till you get your own SVG files.
- There's Pirate Weather API integration since I use that for my Home Assistant.
- I didn't change Google Calendar code since I don't use it Home Assistant. 

PS: Please feel free to to reuse and optimize this code and help me make it better so that I feel least inclined to open my Kindle to bypass the battery to provide power directly.
